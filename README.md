Since this code was used to process confidential data, the used data-sets will not be provided, and as such the code will not run.

Gathering.py was used to create the first data-frames from the original excel sheets.

data_creation.py was used to change those data-frames into smaller data-frames for each level and group.

analysis.py was used to get results from those new data-frames. 

data_control.py was used for small tasks and to see how many students took each course.

test.py had various small tasks but is now nearly empty.
